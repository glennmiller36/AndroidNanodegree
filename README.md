# Udactiy Android Developer Nanodegree

Google has been facing the problem of a huge shortage of Android developers. In fact, it is estimated the number of Android-related developer jobs open as of October 2015 is in the hundreds of thousands, and there are not enough computer engineers to fill the roles. To help solve the problem, Google has partnered with Udacity, an education-tech company, to create a program that teaches software developers how to build apps for Android devices.

The partnership is a called nanodegree program and is a six-course online degree that takes between six to nine months to complete. It costs $200 per month to enroll in the program and takes about 10 hours a week to complete in an average time frame. The coursework is technically free, and the $200 per month pays for things such as project grading, feedback, assistance and final certification.

All the coursework has been developed through a partnership with Google's developer relations team. Top developers teach lessons on camera, and the courses contain the most up-to-date education on how to program for Android devices.
