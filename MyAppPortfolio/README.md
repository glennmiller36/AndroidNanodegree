# My App Portfolio

##Why this Project

The goals of this project are:

* For you to build an app layout that showcases the apps you will build across your Nanodegree journey.
* To introduce you to the process of submitting a project for review. You will be expected to submit projects for review throughout the program, so it's important that you go through the process early.
* To familiarize you with the experience of receiving feedback on your work from Udacity reviewers. Sharing and receiving feedback on your code is a key part of the Nanodegree program.

##Required Tasks

* Download Android Studio.
* Create a new project in Android Studio using the "Application with blank activity" template.
* Create a layout for your main activity, adding a title, buttons for each app, and a style of your choosing.
