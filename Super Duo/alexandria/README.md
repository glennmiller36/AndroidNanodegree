A book list and barcode scanner app.

## How Do I Complete this Project?

Your job will be to take the user feedback in the UX Review node, and implement changes that will make each app production ready.

###Lauren says:

“I like this app generally, and the speed at which books come up on my phone after I enter the ISBN is awesome. I’m frustrated that the scanning functionality isn’t implemented yet. That would speed up the whole process and make the app way more useful for me.”

###Josh says:

“This app is terrible. They say you can scan books, but that functionality isn’t in the app yet. It also crashed on me when I tried to add the book my sister was reading on the flight to London.”
