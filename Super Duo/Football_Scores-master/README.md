# Football Scores

An app that tracks current and future football matches (soccer, for students in the USA).

## How Do I Complete this Project?

Your job will be to take the user feedback in the UX Review node, and implement changes that will make each app production ready.

###Your Boss says:

"It's important to always use an API key when you can. Get your own API key and put it into the strings.xml file."

###Stefan says:

“This app took me a while to figure out, but it is totally worth it! It helps me keep track of when to be glued to my TV, and keeps me up to date when I’m not.”

###Moizeé says:

“I have trouble navigating and understanding this app. It is not accessible to those of us without perfect vision."

###Jennie says:

“I like the functionality of this app, but I hate having to open it up every time I want to check for a new game. Can’t you put something on the home screen for us?”
