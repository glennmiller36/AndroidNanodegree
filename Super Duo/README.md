# Super Duo

You will productionize two apps, taking them from a functional state to a production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

### Why this Project

Super Duo gives you an opportunity to diagnose problems in a pair of apps and also practice improving apps. These skills are vital to building apps users will love.

Diagnosing issues with existing apps is key to working on large apps or continuing projects in Android. Being aware of the common itfalls in app design frees a developer to produce novel app experiences without making the same mistakes over and over.

### What Will I Learn?

In this project, you will:

* Diagnose existing issues with an app.
* Make an app accessible to sight-impaired users.
* Allow your app to be localized for distribution in other countries.
* Handle error cases in Android.
* Add a widget to your app experience.
* Leverage the functionality of a library in your app.

### How Do I Complete this Project?

You will improve two apps for this project:

* Alexandria: A book list and barcode scanner app.

* Football Scores : An app that tracks current and future football matches (soccer, for students in the USA).

You can download the starting code for both apps in the Downloadables section. These apps are currently functional, and work in most cases for most users.

Your job will be to take the user feedback in the UX Review node, and implement changes that will make each app production ready.

All of the issues you need to address to meet specifications are hinted at in the UX Review. There are also a few optional ways in which the apps can be improved that are not mentioned in the UX Review.

### Required Tasks

* Download a zip file of each of the two apps from the Downloadables section.
* Read the UX Review in the next node.
* Spend time exploring the current state of the apps, looking for ways they could be improved. Each app will need 2 or 3 improvements. * Be sure to look specifically at issues called out in the UX Review.
* Execute the improvements!
* For Nanodegree students: Make a single GitHub repo with your code for both apps, and submit through the Nanodegree portal. See the * * Submission and Evaluation node for detailed instructions.

# Rubric

### Required Components

* Alexandria has barcode scanning functionality.
* Alexandria does not crash while searching for a book without an internet connection.
* Football Scores can be displayed in a widget.
* Football Scores app has content descriptions for all buttons.
* Football Scores app supports layout mirroring.

### Required Behavior

* App conforms to common standards found in the Android Nanodegree General Project Guidelines.

### Optional Components

To receive "exceeds specifications", your app must fully implement all of the following items.

* Alexandriaâ€™s barcode scanning functionality does not require the installation of a separate app on first use.
* Extra error cases are found, accounted for, and called out in code comments.
* Football Scores also supports a collection widget.
* Strings are all included in the strings.xml file and untranslatable strings have a translatable tag marked to false.
